```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Using only forloops and ifblocks, write out the R code necessary to print only the elements from the values vector that are not prime
# Use 2 forloops

primes <-c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97)
values <-c(3, 4, 12, 19, 23, 48, 50, 61, 63, 78)

# So, we want 4, 12, 48, 50, 63, 78
